Dictionary is a python data type that is used to store key-value pairs.
It enables you to quickly retrieve, add, remove, modify, values using a key.
Dictionary is very similar to associative array or hash on other languages.

Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
Set is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are *List*, *Tuple*, and *Dictionary*, all with different qualities and usage.
A set is a collection which is *unordered*, *unchangeable*, and *unindexed*.

This README decribes what each script/program is doing:

The file `0-square_matrix_simple.py` is a program that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix.

The file `1-search_replace.py` is a program that replaces all occurrences of an element by another in a new list.

The file `2-uniq_add.py` is a program that adds all unique integers in a list (only once for each integer).

The file `3-common_elements.py` is a program that returns a set of common elements in two sets.

The file `4-only_diff_elements.py` is a program that returns a set of all elements present in only one set.

The file `5-number_keys.py` is a program that returns the number of keys in a dictionary.

The file `6-print_sorted_dictionary.py` is a program that prints a dictionary by ordered keys.

The file `7-update_dictionary.py` is a program that replaces or adds key/value in a dictionary.

The file `8-simple_delete.py` is a program that deletes a key in a dictionary.

The file `9-multiply_by_2.py` is a program that returns a new dictionary with all values multiplied by 2.

The file `10-best_score.py` is a program that returns a key with the biggest integer value.

The file `11-multiply_list_map.py` is a program that returns a list with all values multiplied by a number without using any loops.

The file `12-roman_to_int.py` is a program that converts a Roman numeral to an integer.

The file `100-weight_average.py` is a program that returns the weighted average of all integers tuple `(<score>, <weight>)`.

The file `101-square_matrix_map.py` is a program that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix using `map`

The file `102-complex_delete.py` is a program that deletes keys with a specific value in a dictionary.
