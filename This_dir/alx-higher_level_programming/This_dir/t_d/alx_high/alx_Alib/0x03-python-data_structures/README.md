**Python** knows a number of *compound* data types, used to group together other values. 
The most versatile is the *list*, which can be written as a list of comma-separated values (items) between square brackets.
Lists might contain items of different types, but usually the items all have the same type.

This README decribes what each script/program is doing;

The file `0-print_list_integer.py` is a program that prints all integers of a list.

The file `1-element_at.py` is a program that retrieves an element from a list like in C.

The file `2-replace_in_list.py` is a program that replaces an element of a list at a specific position (like in C).

The file `3-print_reversed_list_integer.py` is a program that prints all integers of a list, in reverse order.

The file `4-new_in_list.py` is a program that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list (like in C).

The file `5-no_c.py` is a program that removes all characters `c` and `C` from a string.

The file `6-print_matrix_integer.py` is a program that prints a matrix of integers.

The file `7-add_tuple.py` is a program that adds 2 tuples.

The file `8-multiple_returns.py` is a program that returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character.

The file `9-max_integer.py` is a program that finds the biggest integer of a list.

The file `10-divisible_by_2.py` is a program that finds all multiples of 2 in a list.

The file `11-delete_at.py` is a program that deletes the item at a specific position in a list.

The file `12-switch.py` is a program that switches value of `a` and `b`.
