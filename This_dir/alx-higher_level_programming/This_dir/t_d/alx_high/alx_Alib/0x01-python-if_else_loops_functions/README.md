Python uses the usual flow control statements known from other languages, with some twists.

This README decribes what each script/program is doing:

The file `0-positive_or_negative.py` is a program that prints a random signed number whether the number stored in the variable `number` is positive or negative.

The file `1-last_digit.py` is a program that prints the last digit of the number stored in the variable `number`.

The file `2-print_alphabet.py` is a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.

The file `3-print_alphabt.py` is a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase except `q` and `e`, not followed by a new line.

The file `4-print_hexa.py` is a program that prints all numbers from `0` to `98` in decimal and in hexadecimal.

The file `5-print_comb2.py` is a program that prints numbers from `0` to `99`.

The file `6-print_comb3.py` is a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.

The file `7-islower.py` is a program that checks for lowercase character.

The file `8-uppercase.py` is a program that prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line.

The file `9-print_last_digit.py` is a program that prints the last digit of a number.

The file `10-add.py` is a program that adds two integers and returns the result.

The file `11-pow.py` is a program that computes `a` to the power of `b` and return the value.

The file `12-fizzbuzz.py` is a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 separated by a space.

The file `13-insert_number.c` is a C program that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list.

The file `lists.h` is a local header file that contains function definitions.

The file `100-print_tebahpla.py` is a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in reverse order, alternating lowercase and uppercase (`z` in lowercase and `Y` in uppercase), not followed by a new line.

The file `101-remove_char_at.py` is a program thatcreates a copy of the string, removing the character at the position `n` (not the Python way, the “C array index”).

The file `102-magic_calculation.py` is the source code of a given Python bytecode.
