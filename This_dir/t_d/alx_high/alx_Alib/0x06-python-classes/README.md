**Classes** and **objects** are the two main aspects of *object oriented programming*.
A class creates a new type where objects are instances of the class. 
An analogy is that you can have variables of type *int* which translates to saying that variables that store integers are variables which are instances (objects) of the int class.

Class name in python is preceded with `class` keyword followed by a colon (`:`).
Classes commonly contains data field to store the data and methods for defining behaviors.
Also every class in python contains a special method called *initializer* (also commonly known as constructors), which get invoked automatically every time new object is created.

This README decribes what each script/program is doing:

The file `0-square.py` is an empty class `Square` that defines a square.

The file `1-square.py` is a class `Square` that defines a square by private attribute `size`: (based on `0-square.py`).

The file `2-square.py` is a class `Square` that defines a square by __init__ `size`: (based on `1-square.py`).

The file `3-square.py` is a class `Square` that defines a square by `area` method: (based on `2-square.py`).

The file `4-square.py` is a class `Square` that defines a square by `getter` and `setter`: (based on `3-square.py`).

The file `5-square.py` is a class `Square` that defines a square by printing `size`: (based on `4-square.py`).

The file `6-square.py` is a class `Square` that defines a square by `size` and `position`: (based on `5-square.py`).

The file `100-singly_linked_list.py` is a class `Node` that defines a node of a singly linked list.

The file `101-square.py` is a class `Square` that defines a square by __str__: (based on `6-square.py`).

The file `102-square.py` is a class `Square` that defines a square by comparison operators: (based on `4-square.py`).

The file `103-magic_class.py` is the source code (class) of a given Python bytecode.
