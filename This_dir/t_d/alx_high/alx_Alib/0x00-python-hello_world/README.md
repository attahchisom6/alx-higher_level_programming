Python enables programs to be written compactly and readably.
Programs written in Python are typically much shorter than equivalent C, C++, or Java programs, for several reasons:
- the high-level data types allow us to express complex operations in a single statement;
- statement grouping is done by indentation instead of beginning and ending brackets;
- no variable or argument declarations are necessary.

This README decribes what each script/program is doing;

The file `0-run` is a Shell script that runs a Python script.
